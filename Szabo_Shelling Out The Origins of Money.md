title={Shelling Out: The Origins of Money}
author={Nick Szabo}

Szabo begins with the story of British colonies in America in the 17th century. The colonists were supposed to grow tobacco, cut timber etc. and ship to England in return for supplies, instead of coins. After a while colonists began trading with native Americans. They used wampum, a sea-shell-based money. Between 1637 and 1661 wampum became legal tender in New England. In 1661 then the British payed the colonnials with coins and wampum became less important. 

> As Dawkins describes it[D89], unless an exchange of favors is simultaneous (and sometimes even then), one party or the other can cheat. And they usually do. This is the typical result of a game theorists call the Prisoner's Dilemna â€“ if both parties cooperated, both would be better off, but if one cheats, he gains at the expense of the sucker. In a population of cheaters and suckers, the cheaters always win.

Examples of cooperation between non-kins in nature
Cleaning fish form long term relationships with their hosts
Vampire bats sometimes form long-term relationship and share food.

Dawkins suggests that "money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism"
Following Dawkin's thought Szabo argues that remembering faces and favors is a major cognitive hurdle, and even more so to retrospectivle value particular favors or mis-favors.

>  Money converts the division of labor problem from a prisoner's dilemma into a simple swap.

Argues how already the first homo sapiens sapiens repaeded benefits by trading food and hunting rights and later collectibles, and specializing in hunting particular animals.


Conclusion: Money provides a way to establish trust and helps to solve coordination problems. Money decreaes transaction costs and therefore implicity adds value to every transaction.
