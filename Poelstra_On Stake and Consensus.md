title={On Stake and Consensus}
author={Andrew Poelstra}
year={2015}

Defines distributed consensus, as used in Bitcoin, as consensus between many mutually-distrusting parties who lack identities and were not necessarily present at the time of system set up.

Mining as a Dynamic Membership Multiparty Signature in the random oracle model.

Poelstra discusses the problem of having no universal time in a distributed system. Otherwise deceiding which transaction was first would be trivial. 

>  It is possible to hold and exchange a
fungible store of value, using public communication media, with cryptographic rather
than physical security preventing fraud or theft. Rather than saying “this encryption key
is worth $10,000 because that’s what it will cost us if its encrypted data is exposed”
one can say “this key is worth $10,000 but can be broken up, sending only $20 of it to
another party while keeping the rest”
