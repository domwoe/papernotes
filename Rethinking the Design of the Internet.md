Rethinking the Design of the Internet: The End-to-End Arguments vs. the Brave New World


* End-to-End arguments important for general-purpose system where then specific applications are then built using this system
* In the original Internet design the end-to-end argument translates that the applications make sure the reliability and integrity of the data transport.

Advantages of the end-to-end principle:
* Complexity of core network is reduced
* Generality in the network increases the chances that a new application can be added without having to change the core of the network.
* Applications do not have to depend on the successful implementation and operation of application-specific services in the network, which may increase their reliability.

Emerging requirements:
* Operation in an untrustworthy world
* More demanding applications (streaming)
* ISP service differentiation
* The rise of third-party involvement
* Less sophisticated users
