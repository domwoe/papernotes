Crystals and Mud in Property Law

Carol M. Rose

Stanford Law Review 1988


Jeremy Bentham: "Property is nothing but a basis of expectation"

"At the root of these economic analyses lies the perception that it costs something to establish clear entitlements to things, and we won't bother to undertake the task of removing goods from an ownerless 'commons' unless it is worth it to us to do so."

"In effect, as our competition for a resource raises the costs of conflict about it, those conflict costs begin outweigh the costs of taking it out of the commons and establishing clear property entitlements. We establish a system of clear entitlements so that we can barter and trade for what we want instead of fighting."

Constant struggle between clear property rules and muddy doctrines.

Duncan Kennedy, who popularized the current distinction between rules and standards, argues that hard-edged, crystal doctrines systematically abandon people to the wiles of the bad and the mean-spirited. As Kennedy reminds us, Holmes even framed these doctrines in terms of the "bad man". They are designed to tell the bad man the limits within which he can get away with his badness. Standards. on the other hand, are aimed at protecting goodness and altruism - whatever internal contradictions may lurk in the notion of enforcing goodness by a legal order.

Thomas Merrill has argued that where transaction costs are low - where it is easy to make a deal - we tend to have clear, hard-edged, yes-or-no rules. 
We find "discretionary" (or muddy) rules where the costs of transacting are high, as, for example, in the area of nuissance doctrine. Here the conflicts typically involve numerous parties, such as the victims of noxious odors that spread through a neighborhood. It is not easy for all affected parties to find each other, to agree on a common strategy, and to negotiate a deal whereby the sufferers pay to have the fumes stopped, or alternatively, where the fume-producing plant pays some agreed-upon price to make up for the sufferings it causes.

Macaulay's work, as well as that of Ian Macneil, suggests that crystalline rules (and their attendant forfeitures) are only designed for people who see each other on a one-time basis, and whose temptations to dupe each other, or simply to play commercial hardball, might be strongest.

The enforceability of clear rules enables us to deal with the world of strangers apart from these communities and to arrange our affairs with persons whom we do not know, and never expect to see again. Crystalline rules thus seem to perform the service of creating context in which strangers can deal with each other in confidence.
