author={Nick Szabo}
year={1993}

Szabo predicts a vast number of multinational small businesses, since the barriers
* prohibitively complex maze of jurisdications
* language/culture
* telecommunication costs
* transport costs
are falling.

Cryptography and privatized selective arbitration lead to targeted information disclosure which will make the process more efficient, cheaper, and decrease risk

Pointed out language and culture as biggest barriert, but pointed also teleconferencing and virtual white boards.
