### Online identity today

* user name and maybe full name
* history of transactions in system
* Permissions on a particular system
* Exposure of data to other systems

Web 1.0 forms
Web 2.0 social logins

Problems:
* weak passwords
* Intercepting recovery mails
* Compromising two-factor authentication
* Compromising the central database

### Decentralized approaches

* Blockstack
* ShoCard
* Evernym
* Airbitz
* uPort
* Identi.fi

### The future?

> Instead of each business building their ever growing silos of sensitive customer data, businesses and regulators could work with a single, secure, shared ledger that manages access to relevant identity data.
