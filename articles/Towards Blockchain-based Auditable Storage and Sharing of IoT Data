## Towards Blockchain-based Auditable Storage and Sharing of IoT Data

Today the cloud plays a central role in storing, processing, and distributing data. Despite contributing to the rapid development of various applications, including the IoT, the current centralized storage architecture has led into a myriad of isolated data silos and is preventing the full potential of holistic data-driven analytics for IoT data. In this abstract, we advocate a data-centric design for IoT with focus on resilience, sharing, and auditable protection of information. We introduce the initial design of our blockchain-based end-to-end encrypted data storage system. We enable a secure and persistent data management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable access control layer to a decentralized storage layer.

###### Notes

Architecture somewhat comparable to Blockstack in the sense that they distinguish between a data and control plane.
Control plane is provided by a blockchain. Transactions consist of access rights to data streams. Data streams are chunked and stored encrypted in a DHT.
