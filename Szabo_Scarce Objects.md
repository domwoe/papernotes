Scarce Objects are computational objects use a finite and excludable resource. Scarce objects provide atomicity, conservation, composition, and accompanying clear delineation of rights and responsibilites across trust boundaries. 

> Access control simply deals with the first-level of issue of whether an entity has access or not to a given resource. If an entity has such access, this access is, as modelled or implemented by basic capabilities or ACLs, effectively unlimited in scope. Scarce objects, on the other hand, limit resource usage in three ways â€“ first, by limiting the amount of resources used per invocation, second, by limiting the number of resources used per right (per ticket), and third, by limiting the number of tickets issued.
