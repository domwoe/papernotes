Named Data Networking of Things

* NDN shifts the communication model from host-centric to data-centric

### IOT Challenges
* Complex solutions to simple communication needs
* Limitations of channel- and session-based security
	* Cloud-centricity and multiple communication channels are a problem
	* Further, securing a channel or session between devices does not tackle how to express identity beyond the addresses of devices, manage the provenance of data, express trust relationships among communicating elements, or handle key distribution.

* Poor integration of local communication

### Applying the NDN architecture to the Internet of Things
* Thin waist = request-response for secured, application-named Data packets
* Data-centric security
* Name-based forwarding
* In-network storage

### Achieve IOT Framework Functionality
