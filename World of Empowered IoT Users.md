World of Empowered IoT Users



As IoT scales to billions of sensors and millions of users, conventional sharing and access control solutions do not scale. It becomes impossible to maintain an Access Control List (ACL) on each single sensor, or near impossible to rely on a centralized access control server, or agreed upon trusted parties based protocols. 

Three main components

* Data management protocol
* Decentralized and distributed data store
* Publish-subscribe messaging service


Within the emerging IoT often times data is stored in a variety of locations, managed by different service providers, and subject to varying regulations. These system less and less frequently have centralized control, and are typically managed by a very diverse group of service providers. Because of these heterogeneous and disparate environments it is often difficult to manage the issues of trust relationship management, data management, regulatory compliance, and data sharing.


Roles:

* Data owner
* Data source
* Data requester
* Endorser


Primitives:
* Data discovery: Users should have an overview of all data they own
* Data request: Subject should be able to search for a collection of data that meets their conditions
* Audit: users should be able to share their data with any chosen data requester, as well as track and monitor the requester's access.
